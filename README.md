#Task 2 Completed
For this task, I utilized the `Sample - Superstore.csv` dataset. This dataset contains detailed information about sales transactions, including product categories, regions, customer segments, sales figures, profit, order dates, and more.
<br/>
My analysis in Power BI focused on understanding the Superstore's performance across various dimensions. Key insights derived from the visualizations include:
<br/>
1.  **Sales Performance by Product Category:**
<br/>
2.  **Profitability Across Regions:**
<br/>
3.  **Sales and Profit Trends Over Time:**
<br/>
The Power BI report is designed as an interactive dashboard, combining these visuals to provide a comprehensive overview of the Superstore's performance. The layout aims to guide the viewer through key performance indicators and highlight areas of strength and areas requiring attention, facilitating data-driven decision-making.
